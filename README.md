# typescript-sandbox

Just a sandbox area for typescript study.
Most files will have errors to show how the TS language will work and what to expect.

Configuration did get changed in this repo to not compile though that is not the norm.

The next steps with TS will be converting my React portfolio to use TS and bolstering the knowledgebase that I keep separately with notes from this repo.
